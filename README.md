## Interview Prep Week

Goal: Allocate dedicated time (typically during week 8) to focus on interview prep activities. 

Below are some suggested activities trainers can conduct with their cohorts. The interview prep week is not limited to these activities and can contain other activities based on the cohort's needs. Work with your training manager to determine the best activities for your cohort.

## Interview Prep Activities


### Hot Seat

<details>
<summary></summary>

Activity duration: **2 hours for a cohort of 15**

This activity works best for smaller cohorts, but can be done with any size cohort if time allows. For this activity you can use a pre-defined list of interview/technical questions (like these), or you can base your questions off of the cohort's curriculum. Select topics throughout the curriculum asking questions like "What is x technology," "Why do we use x technology," and "How can we implement x technology." Popcorn around the room, asking each associate a question or two before moving on to the next associate. After each response, ask the group for feedback: Do they agree with the answer? Is there anything they would have said differently? Was there anything that they liked about the answer?

The benefit of this activity is that everyone in the cohort has the ability to provide feedback, as well as hear examples of great responses and responses that need improvement. Associates who struggle under pressure or in front of a group may not do as well with this activity.

### Mock Interviews 

<details>
<summary></summary>

Activity duration: **15 hours for a cohort of 15**

Mock interviews also give associates exposure to interview questions, practice answering them, and an opportunity for valuable feedback, but in a one on one setting. See [this document](https://revature0-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/personal/charles_jester_revature_com/Documents/MockInterviewOutline.docx?d=w5c91cd12f10a41659eb0f67baab08479&csf=1&web=1&e=OZlLGy) for suggestions on how to conduct and evaluate mock interviews.

### Associate Paired Interviews 

<details>
<summary></summary>

Activity duration: **2 hour for a cohort of 15 + 30 mins - 1 hr of prep time**

For this activity, pair up associates and have them interview each other. Prior to the activity, you'll need to put together two question sheets to guide the associates. An example can be found here for full stack Java questions, but these questions should be modified depending on what you want this activity to focus on. 

Have one associate interview the other using their question sheet. They should take notes on their partner's answers. After completing the sheet (or after 45 minutes), the recording associate should review any feedback they have for their partner. The associates can take a short break before reversing roles and having the previous interviewee become the interviewer. They have a second question sheet with different questions that they ask, before reviewing feedback with their partner as well. The trainer can ask that their question sheet or just that the feedback be relayed to them for feedback on each associate.

The benefit of this activity is that associates feel less pressure to answer questions in front of a peer than a whole group or a trainer. They're also able to candidly discuss topics with one another to get different perspectives on topics and responses. If there are two cohorts ending around the same time with a similar curriculum, this is a great activity to with both concurrently. Pair associates with one from each cohort. There is also very little trainer overhead needed to conduct this activity, and can even be done when a trainer is occupied by other tasks or needs to be in meetings.

The drawback is that they don't get as much, if any, trainer feedback on their interview answers. This could be a good activity to do prior to other trainer led activities to get associates more comfortable in a low pressure situation.

### STAR Method Exercise

<details>
<summary></summary>

Activity duration: **Variable (can be worked into other activities) but should include at least 1 hour of associate prep time**

The STAR method is a method for answering behavioral interview questions that provides a structural guideline to anecdotal answers. It begins by explaining the situation you were in, and the task at hand. You follow by discussing the action you took and the result of that action. It allows you to back up your interview answers with concrete evidence from your experiences.

Start by providing [this overview](https://revature0-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/personal/emily_baillie_revature_com/Documents/Microsoft%20Teams%20Chat%20Files/STAR_Method_Interviews.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=aO0s1i) of the STAR method to your team. Give them at least a day to read over it and familiarize themselves with the method and tell them to be ready to use it when answering interview questions in your desired format (full cohort, small groups, individually). 

For the activity itself, ask the associates open ended questions that are good candidates for the star method. Provide feedback to the associates. A template similar to the one below can be used to record their responses. Some questions you can ask include:
- Tell me about a time when you had a conflict with a co-worker.
- Describe a time when you had to manage numerous responsibilities. What did you do to complete the tasks?
- Tell me about a time when you failed. What did you learn from this encounter?
- Give an example of a goal you reached and tell me how you achieved it.
- Tell me about a difficult bug you resolved in your code.
- Tell me about a time you had a disagreement with your manager.
- What is your greatest strength?
- What is your biggest known area of improvement?

### Whiteboarding Exercises


<details>
<summary></summary>

Activity duration: **20 minutes per associate (15 for exercise, 5 minute for feedback)**

See [this repo](https://github.com/carolynrehm/whiteboarding) for some helpful whiteboarding exercises. Questions can be solved in another language if it's relevant to the training tack, but example solutions are provided in Java. Feel free to suggest alternative solutions, or solutions in other languages.
